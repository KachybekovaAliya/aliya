My first Python project 
Actually, I used to code on python in school back to 8-9th grade. Unfortunately, due to the large amount of time without any practice I had forgotten everything.
Starting from 21 October I begin new journey in Python.
In this project i will study python from very beginning. My goal is to create at least 2 projects and become a fluent Python user. 
Requirements:
In this repository i use python 3.14.0 along with VS code on my laptop IdeaPad Slim 3 14IRU9 with Windows 11 Operating System
